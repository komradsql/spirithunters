# spirithunters

A huge project that I worked on for 3 months alone. Everything is applied here: HTML, CSS (more than 8000 lines of code via SCSS), Javascript. After this project, I studied JS in more depth, but in the end I came to the conclusion that site building is not my thing and moved to iOS development. I put this project here (it is still working for the customer who orderd and he is OK that i did this), so that there is a reminder of the past.
